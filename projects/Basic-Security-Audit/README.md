## **Denial of Service (DoS)**

### **Example 1: Gas Limit Exhaustion**

#### **Cause**
- The attacker creates a contract that repeatedly executes computationally expensive operations, causing the gas limit of a transaction to be exceeded.
- This prevents other users from interacting with the smart contract.

#### **Fix**
- Use gas-efficient coding practices, such as:
  - Avoid looping through large arrays in a single transaction.
  - Utilize off-chain computation where possible.
- Implement **fail-safe mechanisms** such as gas estimation checks before performing expensive operations.

---

### **Example 2: Storage Overflow**

#### **Cause**
- Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in data storage logic, such as unbounded `mapping` growth or incorrectly handled edge cases, to deplete gas or render a function unusable.

#### **Fix**
- Use **require statements** to validate inputs and edge cases.
- Ensure proper indexing and size restrictions for mappings or arrays.

## **Reentrancy Attacks**

### **Example: Reentrant Function Calls**

#### **Cause**
- Reentrancy occurs when an external contract calls back into the calling contract before the first execution is complete.
- This can manipulate state variables in unintended ways, such as draining funds.

#### **Fix**
1. **Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**:
   - **Checks**: Validate conditions (e.g., balances) before state changes.
   - **Effects**: Update state variables.
   - **Interactions**: Interact with external contracts as the last step.

2. **Leverage Solidity's Built-In Protection**:
   - Use the `reentrancyGuard` modifier (provided by libraries like OpenZeppelin).

3. **Minimize External Calls**:
   - Reduce reliance on external contracts whenever possible.

## **Weak Randomness**

### **Example: Predictable Random Numbers**

#### **Cause**
- Solidity relies on pseudo-random values such as `block.timestamp`, `blockhash`, or `msg.sender`, which can be manipulated or predicted by miners.
- Attackers can exploit this predictability to gain an unfair advantage in lotteries or other random-based functionalities.

#### **Fix**
1. **Use External Oracles**:
   - Integrate a trusted randomness oracle like Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to generate secure random numbers.

2. **Avoid On-Chain Randomness**:
   - Never rely solely on block data or user inputs for randomness.

3. **Combine Multiple Sources**:
   - While less secure than an oracle, combining multiple unpredictable sources (e.g., user seeds + blockhashes) can add complexity.

4. **Delay Randomness Execution**:
   - Introduce time delays between the random value generation and its use to reduce exploitation risks.
