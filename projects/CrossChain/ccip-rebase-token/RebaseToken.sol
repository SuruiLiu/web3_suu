// A rebase token is a type of token or cryptocurrency where the total supply adjusts based on a specific algorithm 
// to reflect changes in underlying value or accrued rewards rather than the price of the token changing. 
// These adjustments are called rebases.

// There are two main types of rebased tokens:

// 1. Rewards rebase tokens: These tokens are designed for earning rewards, like interest in lending or borrowing.
// 2. Stable value tokens: These tokens are designed to keep their value stable regardless of market fluctuations.
